# Hi there, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ who likes robots and embedded systems.
My interests are in real-time embedded systems, [non-linear optimization](https://github.com/nuft/nls) and its applications in robotics.

I'm currently working at [ANYbotics](https://www.anybotics.com/), where we're building a robotic workforce for industrial inspection.

#### Open Source Work

- [OCS2](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/ocs2): A MPC toolbox tailored for switched systems used for legged locomotion and mobile manipulation.
- [PolyMPC](https://github.com/PREDICT-EPFL/polympc/tree/master): A tool for real-time nonlinear model predictive tracking and path following, for which I implemented an SQP-based nonlinear problem solver.
- [CVRA](https://cvra.ch/) [robot software stack](https://github.com/cvra/robot-software) for the Eurobot competition. See [their GitHub](https://github.com/cvra) for more open source/hardware work.

#### Open Hardware Work

- [CAN to USB adapter](https://github.com/cvra/CAN-USB-dongle) compatible with the SLCAN protocol.
- [Vacuum pump controller](https://github.com/cvra/actuator-board) for a robot gripper with a pressure sensor for feedback and connected via CAN bus.
- [ToF distance and color sensor board](https://github.com/cvra/sensor-board) connected via CAN bus.
- [Tiny CAN-connected IO board](https://github.com/cvra/can-io-board) featuring 4 digital inputs and 4 PWM outputs
